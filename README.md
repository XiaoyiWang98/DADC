# D&DC: Donators & Donation collectors (under development)

### Goals
Due to Covid-19, it is risky for people to make item donations in person.
Alternatively, they could wait for NGOs, such as Goodwill, to collect those donations by chance.
However, the NGOs have no idea when or where these items will be. 
To facilitate the donation collection process, we are developing a web platform to support 
 1) Donators post an item for donation
 2) An NGO schedule a pick-up if there are enough items for donations
 3) (advanced feature) an advanced route planning for each pick-up to collect as many as items within a time limit. 
  

### What is D&DC?
It is a react-app based solution for donation pickup management and pickup route optimization. 
It is deployed on AWS-Amplify at https://master.d25hrbybky3fg.amplifyapp.com/
